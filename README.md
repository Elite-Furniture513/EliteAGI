# ELITE — Retail Calculator v4

**Fixes & upgrades requested**
- **Mode chooser is now high‑contrast** with larger cards, icons, bigger text, and a brighter panel.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `1` Normal, `2` Financing, `3` Layaway. Arrow keys move; **Enter** selects; **Esc** closes.
- **Visible focus ring** and hover glow for accessibility and easier selections.
- **Single‑file fix**: embedded print page now escapes `</script>` as `<\/script>` so the app never spills JS text at the top.

**Everything else remains from v3**
- Financing can include **Delivery** and/or **Assembly** in the financed amount (items → delivery → assembly order).
- Sticky bottom bar with big number and Print.
- Clean print view with a financing breakdown.

Open `index.html` to use it, or open the single‑file HTML for a one‑click version.
